# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

* STM32 IDE
* QEMU


# COMPONENTS
* STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD


# REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION:
## STM32F407VG
* The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family is based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 168 MHz.
*  The Cortex-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all Arm single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. 
*  It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security. 
*  The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family incorporates high-speed embedded system.


## Xpack Packages :

### Windows Build Tools: 
* The xPack Windows Build Tools is a standalone Windows binary distribution of GNU make and a few of other tools required by the Eclipse Embedded CDT (formerly GNU MCU/ARM Eclipse) project, but the binaries can also be used in generic build environments.

### OpenOCD :
* Open On-Chip Debugger (OpenOCD) is a free, open-source project that aims to provide debugging, in-system programming, and boundary scan using a debug adapter. 
* The adapter is a hardware module that provides the right signals for the target to understand.


### QEMU :
* The xPack QEMU Arm is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of QEMU, with several extensions for Arm Cortex-M devices.

# WORKING PRINCIPLE
* Assume that the automobile is the microcontroller. 
* If the push button is long pressed , the first led (red) will turn on. Hence, the engine starts.
* Clicking the push button again, the wiper will start, and the second led (blue) will turn on, moving at a desired rate. 
* If the button is clicked again, the third led (green) will turn on, and the wiper's speed will be increased in comparison to the previous one. 
* With the fourth press,  the fourth led (orange) will turn on, and the wiper speed will be increased in accordance with the previous one. 
* The microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off after the fifth press which would a long press.

# 4W's & 1H
### WHAT
* The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions.
### WHY
* To keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times. 
### WHEN
* The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.
### WHO
* A wiper speed control system for an automobile manages the wiper's functioning speed in response to weather conditions which is helpful for the drivers.
### HOW
* You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system according to the rainfall.
### WHERE
* In general, car wipers are controlled by the stalk on the right side of the steering wheel.
